            ## Epilepsy12

            ### 2022

            -----
            
            # The RCPCH Epilepsy12 Audit
            
            * National Audit of Epilepsy care for the first 12 months following diagnosis
            
            ---
            
            # Drawbacks with the existing E12 platform
            
            * No API, meaning there is no way for other systems to send data automatically
            * Poor user interface
            * Many redundant questions and required inputs, which made filling in the audit quite arduous
            * Correspondingly low response rate
            * Proprietary software, supplied by external contractor.
            * Limited options for improvement of UI or additional features eg API

            # Application approach
            
            (This bit is for the geeks - it's not necessary to understand this stuff to understand the project as a whole.)
            
            * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - a well established, open-source Python-based web framework
            * An API comes as standard (well, with very minimal additional effort) with Django
            * Reliable framework in use with Instagram, Spotify, YouTube, Dropbox and Eventbrite [ref](https://djangostars.com/blog/10-popular-sites-made-on-django/)
            
            ---
            
            # User Interface approach
            
            * Using Django's native templating and server-side rendering for the majority of the app
            * Semantic UI - an open source UI toolkit 
            * Pared-down UI to streamline data entry
            * In the future, some sites may be able to pre-fill data fields via the API, saving further user time
            
            ---
            
            # Data model approach
            
            * Detailed review of every field of the existing data model was conducted
            * Many unused fields removed
            * Streamlined data model based on real-world requirements for

            # API detail
            
            * REST API is a widely used and understood web standard
            * Relatively simple to integrate a Trust EPR with an external API
            * Independent of the system used by the Trust

            Interface detail
            
            * Web-based interface, browser-based
            * Independent of the operating system in use
